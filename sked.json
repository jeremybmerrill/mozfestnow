Through a shared  testing and walkthrough of the teaching kit with and for people interested in the future of their local urban environments, the workshop is a collaborative brainstorming session on how to effectively use and activate the kit in our own neighbourhood situations.",

As urban activists we are interested in working with participants coming from a global array of cities to beta test the use of the kit at MozFest.\n\nThe Your Story Goes Here teaching kit outlines all the steps in a workshop that combines both online and offline activities. In the kit we walk people through various aspects of creating and telling digital stories using freely available open source ‘storytelling machines’ and focus on the impacts of city building or urban planning on the real lives and experiences of people.  By starting with our own neighbourhoods and environments we see this as a way to foster and develop confident ‘citizen planners’ who can then become advocates for better, smarter, more resilient choices in the development of their own local precincts.\n\nIn this DIY Urbanism session, we will discuss the impacts and issues of urban planning in the participants’ home neighbourhoods and then do a walk-through of the kit activities in a predetermined area of Ravensbourne - as our collaborative test site.",

Unfortunately, the current reward system in academia often fails to give credit for contributions beyond authorship. Recently, there has been work to move toward a system that both recognises the diversity of roles in a research group as well as reward openness and sharing in the sciences. On the  technical side, the Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure is a system to recognise expertise or demonstrate accomplishments without traditional means of recognition. In terms of taxonomy, Digital Science, the Wellcome Trust and others have developed a working taxonomy of research contributorship. A prototype is needed to put this in action. With the new Badges Pathways/Discovery, a way to better visualise the usefulness of badges not just in reward but career progression for researchers is now available. With ORCiD , we have another essential building block to integrate into this award mechanism.\n\nThe aim of a badges session would be to begin to craft badges using the above-mentioned taxonomy, to build Research Pathways using these badges, and to work with essential partners (Mozilla Badge Community and Science Lab, ORCiD, Digital Science, Center for Open Science, BMC, and PLoS) to map out an implementable prototype for integrating such badges into the journal article.",
    "agenda": "The session would begin with a presentation on the badges—how they have been used thus far (case studies), their infrastructure, and how one might imagine them being used in research. Then we would split up into 3 working groups: a crafting station, a Pathways station, and a prototyping station. \n\n•\tBadges Crafting. Using the existing contributorship taxonomy, we would begin to craft/design actual badges. If we were using badges to recognise all activities in research science, what would they be? Before MozFest we could set up an Etherpad to get this going and solicit some community feedback via Twitter and blogs.  \n•\tScience hack of Pathways. Let’s create researcher pathways. This would include developing use cases using the taxonomy and applying it to your own career as a researcher. \n•\tCodesprint for the contributorship badges journal workflow. There has already been some discussion between BMC and Mozilla Science Lab as to how this would integrate into the journal article via a “PaperBadger”, a third party site where authors of a paper would complete a matrix on contributorship and iterate until they all had agreed. The authors would then, in agreement as a collaboration, issue their own badges. This would integrate with the publisher site via API. This working group would depend on finding dev resource willing to create and host this third party site. Depending on resources, this group could further discuss the workflow/storyboards just described or it could actually get to work and begin building the site. Hopefully the latter!",

Each group will work on the same dataset and will use different tools to achieve similar results. Participants will spend 30 minutes to explore the data, formulate questions and understand what “messy data” means.

For less experienced culture hackers, we have compiled easy to understand step-by-step guidance, e.g. on creating animated GIFs. During the day there will be sub-sessions on open cultural data and content in Europeana, introduction to APIs, open licenses and attribution.

One of the key questions asked by organisations is around the administration of the Open Badges. By utilising computer to computer communication this task of administration is dealt with automatically.The problem is: when should computer to computer interaction be placed within a system that will end up being most beneficial to all the stakeholders? So the participants will be given a real world scenario that the Mozilla Open Badges system could support and ask to collaborate to create the best system solution. The scenarios will originate from the following sectors: transport, entertainment and education (NB: not for rewarding skills and achievements).",

Sacrilege, you might think. What good could possibly come from this?\n\nThat’s what YourFry is all about.\n\nCome and join the YourFry team where you, the planet of creative and tech minds, can deconstruct and repurpose the words and themes from Stephen’s last two books. Just think of all the new and vibrant media that you could create for a fresh audience to read, view and enjoy.\n\nStephen Fry and Penguin’s YourFry project has been created to ask questions about the nature of how we create and publish autobiography in the digital environment. The web is responsive, interactive and chaotic – what if the conventional autobiography is thrown open to the web? What might the results look like, what form might they take?",

These are detection points that look for your devices and capture their ids and a photo when you are nearby. A separate machine collects as many pieces of data together that it can that can connect to each id, and will show it to you if you click a button.\n\nThese technologies are used by companies to track us for commercial purposes. The ethical dilemma is one we face every time we go into a space with tracking systems like this: do we enjoy the benefits of our mobile phone and be tracked, not knowing what data is being held by whom or used for what? or do we give up our phones?\n\nPrivacy policy: your data will never leave the closed network we have created for this prototype, and will be deleted at the end of the day.",

In the past few years, the government has slowly been introducing trash collection, sanitation and electricity services into these areas which has had both  positive and negative repercussions. More recently, residents have complained about what they say are excessive bills from the energy company. This could be both a result of the fact that most of the newly-installed meters are collective and divided by a number of adjacent households (versus individual meters) as well as the fact that residents, who were not accustomed to paying for electricity, were not aware of their own high consumption, often leaving lights and AC connected throughout the day.\nThis projects seeks to develop a prototype that will work towards solving both these problems by turning off the lights and AC as soon as people leave the house and will also inform people of their own energy consumption by SMS. This project will bring awareness to people about their energy use and also give them reliable data to contest abusive electricity charges.",

Scientists among the participants will then go around and cluster the topics, putting up their own work on the same map. We will also ask any ‘openness’ practitioners to share their insights, thoughts and ideas on how open practices can be introduced to, or scaled further in the ideas and projects shared. This will allow us to gain insight into areas of overlaps, facilitating an introduction to the OCSD Network (www.ocsdnet.org) and hopefully act as an identification process for whom to engage in the OCSD Network and wider community.\nThis will be a highly interactive session, for approximately 60 minutes.",

Now, some handsets are within reach of mass affordability. The benefits of the internet could reach poorer people, around a billion of them.\n\nBut generally, platforms and content are rarely designed for this huge, diverse target audience and as a consequence, owning a smartphone does not automatically lead to the purchase of a data plan.\n\nIn the mix of content, Indians will want news. They like the news. They buy newsapapers in huge numbers and watch TV avidly. News is important.\n\nI have designed a platform that overcomes the restrictions of language, literacy and access to low-end tech: digital news in comic-book form.\n\nI will explain the background and digital landscape in more detail, and then I want to get people drawing comics and telling stories. I will need feedback to develop the design, the UX and everything else. I am not a developer so I could really use some help.",

I will explain how they might be overcome, using a comic-based platform.\n\nLanguage – users are less likely to speak English. This represents a big problem in terms of staffing, translation and scale.\n\nLiteracy – 25% of the country is illiterate. Digital literacy is an additional challenge.\nLow bandwidth – these are not iPhones on 4G. The processing power is low, and the connection itself is also erratic.\n\nLow attention span – there is a lot of competition for users’ time. We will need to figure out a way to make news engaging, necessary and shareable.",
    "agenda": "Comics have a long history in India and are an established, popular form of storytelling. Many Indian children, including those in the diaspora (like me), learned all about Indian history, culture and mythology through a wonderful set of comic books called Amar Chitra Katha.\n\nAs a digital medium, the comic storyboard is simple, engaging, shareable and adaptable. \n\nThe session will have the following structure, illustrated with slides and some video:\n\n- an explanation of the current state of the Indian digital landscape, in the context of basic development indices in the country.\n\n- why do Indians like news? Why is it important? I will refer to the last election, where digital media and technology played an important role\n\n- who are these new internet users?\n\n- finally, on to the four challenges I’ve outlined above, why they’re so difficult and how my comic book idea is a possible solution.",

Many organisations do open very well, but it's a lot harder to be open.  This session aims to help participants identify points in their working practice where these values are being implemented, and where more work needs to be done.

The typical workflow of writing and debugging a parser involves a level of technical expertise that the average citizen might not have, and forces seasoned coders to spend more time dealing with technical issues than discovering insights in the data itself.\n\nThis workshop introduces streamtools: an open-source visual toolkit facilitating working with data. Streamtools allows users to explore data through a GUI, making changes on the fly. This realtime feedback loop and accessible interface allows developers--both seasoned and new to coding--to ask better questions about the data around them. We will show attendees how they can use streamtools to explore information, and guide them through the process of making patterns that are meaningful to them and their community.",

We’ll be looking at how apps can help scientists and local communities to work together to help measure and alleviate climate change impact. \n\nThe workshop will have two goals; First, we’ll aim to draw up a big wish list of components needed for citizen science apps but not yet in AppMakers (location services is a good example) which we can contribute to the AppMaker ‘most wanted components’ list.",

We’ll also give a quick run-through of AppMaker itself and the AppMaker component building process (Polymer, etc.).\n\nThen we’ll brainstorm ideas for apps in breakout groups. We'll encourage participants to team up on apps, but you're welcome to be anti-social if you wish (as coders, we understand this...). \n\nWe’ll get back together to look at what we’ve come up with, and to draw up the Wish List for AppMaker components. \n\nFinally, we’ll start  hacking some apps which we can post as examples.",

    "agenda": "The agenda for the session as follows:\n\nIntroductions\nOverview of why data is important in the digital domain \nBrief talk about the importance of linking data (Ted talk video of Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee) and how this idea fits in with Mozilla Open Badges \nTalk about my findings of the NESTA project - Blackpool Volunteer centre's 'Do a Bit' project (URL: http://bit.ly/1qxRzYd )\nAn example of a case study will be shown as a demonstration to set expectations.\nThe participants will develop the case study.\nThe participants will showcase their solutions to the group.\nSummary and conclusion.",

The Badge Alliance Research Working Group, in collaboration with the Workforce Working Group, would then align that plan of action with information gathered from a research-oriented survey being distributed internationally in August / September 2014 in an effort to facilitate future investigations into digital badges.",
    "agenda": "Prior to the session (e.g., all day Saturday), a brainstorming worksheet (large pieces of paper) will be placed at each track / interest area at Mozilla Festival asking three questions: 1) what skills or experiences do you look for in hiring junior collaborators / entry workers?; 2) how might badges recognize high quality applications of this skill / experience?; and 3) would you/your organization make a hiring decision based on these badges? Briefly explain.\n\nDuring the actual session (e.g., early Sunday), these sheets will be gathered and attendees will begin distilling similarities during a synchronous session. Through whole group discussion and small working groups, we will work to identify similarities and differences within and across areas using post-its.\n\nThe final exercise will involve identifying key questions across the identified themes and developing a reasonable plan of action to answer those questions. This will be accomplished by breaking into logical groups based on themes and then sharing and discussing with the large group.",

The images are not identified as authored by a particular person, so the shared 'archive' becomes metaphorically similar to looking through photos at an antique shop.  The images are intriguing visually yet we don't know the back story.\n\nAs a group while studying the images we focus on locating the common themes that emerge in this shared image bank.  In a Lo Fi brainstorming session we create a large 'story concept map' which will become the framework of our co-authored story.  We will identify commonalities, differences, details and map these as story nodes on our paper concept map.  For instance, we may find that many people have similar images documenting shadows, alleyways in cities, trips to forests, gatherings of people, or food pictures.  We will find these 'similar-but-different' moments stored on people's smart phones - moments that have been documented through these ubiquitous image-capturing devices, ie. camera's that are with us at all times.  Often we take hundreds or even thousands of images that may not 'make it' through an edit.  We want to consider these types of images - happenstance, simple documents that may actually get deleted because they aren't necessarily documenting the moment satisfactorily.\n\nAfter we make our contributions to the shared story archive, the images will then be processed by the facilitators - making them all appear like 'black and white ink drawings' - referencing graphic novel drawings.  This technique is a strategy to create the appearance of a cohesive set of images to be used in the telling of the story.\n\nWe then begin to 'storyboard' the shared images, playing with the notion of the 'exquisite corpse' game, we will look at the images for resonant frame to frame transitions, interesting flow and begin to organize them into their story-order.  We individually, of course, only know the 'real story' behind our own images.  This allows us to look at the shared sets with 'fresh eyes', and affords us the freedom to assign new fictional narratives based on the images' connection to other shared images, how they resonate and speak with one another through formal and/or implied connections -  and their potential to add unique elements to the new co-created story.\n\nThe group collectively decides on the final image ordering for the story.\n\nIf the group as a whole has decided to create textual elements as part of the story we will co-author as well.  Text could be used as a kind of connective tissue between series of frames or to create an overarching narrative. This element would be brainstormed in the Lo Fi paper story mapping activity as well.\n\nFor review and construction within the workshop we use simple software application to create a sequential 'slide show' - allowing the participants to see the story results in 'real time' and affords the ability to do live 'frame' editing.",

Hybrid mobile apps are apps written in web technologies that can run on natively across any device including Android, FirefoxOS, or iOS. This means developers can write an app once in HTML5 and have it work everywhere without having to rewrite code. In this session, we'll talk about how the web community is currently trying to attract developers to the open web platform, and how we could attract developers through more resources on hybrid mobile apps. We'll then break out into a small app building session using Ionic and Cordova to build hybrid apps. There will also be the option of playing with pre-built hybrid apps if developing is not your thing.",

In almost no time you can test your ideas and know if they are really fun or not, focusing your efforts in what matters the most: designing your game!",

The Genome Analysis Centre is leading publicly-funded projects to improve researcher knowledge of data description and deposition avenues, aiding reproducible research in the life sciences.\n\nIn this two-hour session, we will round out various existing lessons by filling in missing content and adding domain examples. We will also conduct lightweight peer review from at least two participants unfamiliar with the topic, similar to the “500 Lines” reviewing sprint done at PyCon 2014. To make the session as productive as possible, we plan to post lessons (or at least lesson outlines) on a GitHub repository (https://github.com/karthik/mozfest-data-lessons) in early October to get enthusiastic participants organized ahead of time. All material developed at this session will be shared with a CC BY license for use in any teaching effort including those led by the organizers. \n\nLinks\n\nWorkshop repository: https://github.com/karthik/mozfest-data-lessons\nData Carpentry: http://datacarpentry.org\nMozilla Science Lab: http://mozillascience.org\nSchool of Data: http://schoolofdata.org\nSoftware Carpentry: http://software-carpentry.org\nrOpenSci: http://ropensci.org\nThe Genome Analysis Centre: http://www.tgac.ac.uk",

In the weeks leading up to Mozfest we'll start posting potential topics as issues and soliciting small groups of 2-3 folks per lesson. \nIf you're not ready to jump in that early, take a look a few days before the event kicks off for topics you can jump into, especially ones for while you can help flesh out examples.\nDrop into the session and help review one or more lessons. Partner up with someone working on a topic unfamiliar to you and help them fine tune the presentation (You'll learn a new data skill along the way!).\nDon't know how to create lessons about data? Come join a group and learn with them as they develop something new.",

We have been discussing this with Mozilla (Dave Steer and Mark Surman) about this.

One of the key questions asked by organisations is around the administration of the Open Badges. By utilising computer to computer communication this task of administration is dealt with automatically.The problem is: when should computer to computer interaction be placed within a system that will end up being most beneficial to all the stakeholders? So the participants will be given a real world scenario that the Mozilla Open Badges system could support and ask to collaborate to create the best system solution. The scenarios will originate from the following sectors: transport, entertainment and education (NB: not for rewarding skills and achievements).",

Conceiving “#BanglaMake” theme, calling several meetings online/offline, describing the importance of our culture and custom they were inspired, motivated to commit for 40 (forty) parties. They are taking pictures, videos, interviewing craftsman, farmers, fishers, potters for  thimble, popcorn.

Using paper prototyping and open source tools we will enable participants to design their own badge, and release it into the game.

An art (un)installation using Flowhub.io and a couple of drawing robots, people will interact with robots, painting together with them to create a collaborative canvas. The installation can run together with Forrest Oliphant's workshop on Dataflow Animation and we can hack together to extend Flowhub.io to talk with Mirobot.io. Different input mechanisms for the robots (code blocks, data flow, canvas) will be explored, and a beamer will project a preview of the path to visualize where the robot  will draw before it starts. We would like the hack session / workshop to extend through the afternoon on both days, to have enough time to see the drawings and drawing code evolve. Artworks produced during the (un)installation can be for sale at the MozFest Art Bazaar.",

While translation is a large part of this, it’s not the only part, localization is done by adding locale-specific components and testing usability. We will show how crowdsourced localization uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization to translate and provide usability input. \n \nWe crowdsource localization through group, and want to emphasize that they are important stakeholders: they request languages, provide technical, linguistic, legal, and cultural input; the more active members are reviewers and language coordinators, and we ask them first to give feedback and expertise in geographical regions. In turn, the developers have a space where they can learn and exchange ideas with the end user.",

Come along if you want to learn:\n* How to import data into a spreadsheet, format it properly and how to begin interpreting it using the ‘sort’ and ‘filter’ functions.\n* Understand what your data might mean by using spreadsheet formulae and basic charts\n* The most powerful tool for summarising data in spreadsheets: pivot tables \n\nWhat to bring: a computer with a spreadsheet tool installed (Libre Office Calc, Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets)",

For now we are 2 facilitators but we will recruit more on the spot and try to have a facilitator for each group.\n\nOnce the groups are formed, we will give them a real dataset to work on. In the first 30 minutes they will have to explore the data and formulate questions. Each group will tackle 2-3 questions (based on complexity) and will work hands on with the data practising different functionalities like sort, filter, formulae, pivot tables, etc. In the last 15 minutes all groups will quickly present their findings and discuss the most important lesson learned.",

The objective of this session is giving the participants knowledge about concepts behind  privacy enhancing software and encryption tools.  This is a human centered approach to privacy tools - improve the users' mental model of the software and they will have a better idea of how it works. You will learn how privacy enhancing tools work through role-playing, group activities, and playing out scenarios. We will start off with a discussion about privacy concerns people have with online activities. We also want to empower the participants to regain some control of their online activities.  To re-enforce this taking control, we will use the \"Stop, Start, Keep\" process. Join us to share your start/stop/keeps. #PRIVACYSTART.  Everyone is entitled to communicate privately, and securely. Learn how Off the Record IM encryption works, how the TOR Browser works, and how asymmetric encryption (like PGP) works.  This session will also offer practical advice and guides for anyone to self-host their own email, websites and share files securely without relying on a single large infrastructure provider like Google or Amazon (but it will work with them too).  everyone should understand how their private, personal data is now at risk of being shared with third parties without their knowledge. Hosting your own email, websites and file sharing can help reduce that risk.If you can use a computer, you can host your own email in as little as five steps using free/libre open source software (FLOSS).",

In this session, we'll discuss examples of smart audience critiques of data journalism, and ways that news organizations could be more transparent about their sources and methods.
